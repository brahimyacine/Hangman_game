# Hangman game
A desktop application of the famous hangman game

This is a french version of the classic letter guessing game called Hangman. You are shown a set of blank letters that match a word or phrase and you have to guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word.
You guess by typing letters in the corresponding boxes. If you type a letter that is in the word, a sound is played and that letter is revealed from the blank letters; however, if you type a letter that is not in the word, then a stickman is slowly drawn. With each wrong letter guess, the man is drawn more and more. When the man is finished, he is hung and the game is lost.

The game was written in Java & JavaFx for the GUI
